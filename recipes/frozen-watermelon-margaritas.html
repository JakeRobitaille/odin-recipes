        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This melon drink is cool and refreshing. Because of the watermelon's natural sweetness, 
            we can keep the added sugar low and not feel guilty about drinking them! (maybe a little)

        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup Water</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Cup White Sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Teaspoons Chopped Rosemary or Basil</li>
            <li>6 Cups Cubed Seeded Watermelon</li>
            <li>1 Cup Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon White Sugar</li>
            <li>8 Fluid Ounces Tequila of Choice</li>
            <li>Rosemary or Basil for Serving</li>
            <li>Watermelon Wedges for Serving</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring 1 cup water and 1/3 cup sugar to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar. Stir in chopped rosemary or basil. Let steep for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Strain rosemary or basil syrup into a blender. Add watermelon and lemon juice. Pur√©e until smooth, about 30 seconds. Strain lemonade mixture, then freeze in ice cube trays until solid, about 8 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Mix together salt and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in a small shallow dish. Lightly dampen rims of 4 (12-ounce) glasses with a wet paper towel. Roll glass rims in salt-sugar mixture until coated.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, blend half of the frozen watermelon-lemonade cubes and 4 ounces tequila in a blender or food processor until slushy, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of water as needed to help blend mixture. Pour into prepared glasses. Repeat with remaining watermelon-lemonade cubes and remaining tequila. Garnish with rosemary or basil, and watermelon wedges.</li>
